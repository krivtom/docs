# What is Windows Forms

Welcome to the Desktop Guide for Windows Forms, a UI framework that creates rich desktop client applications for Windows. The Windows Forms development platform supports a broad set of application development features, including controls, graphics, data binding, and user input. Windows Forms features a drag-and-drop visual designer in Visual Studio to easily create Windows Forms applications.

There are two implementations of Windows Forms:

01. The open-source implementation hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms). This version runs on .NET 5. The Windows Forms Visual Designer requires, at a minimum, [Visual Studio 2019 version 16.X](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=inline+link&utm_content=download+vs2019+desktopguide+winforms).

01. The .NET Framework implementation that's supported by Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2017.

This Desktop Guide is written for Windows Froms on .NET 5. For more information about the existing documentation for WPF with the .NET Framework, see [Framework Windows Presentation Foundation](../../framework/wpf/index.md).
